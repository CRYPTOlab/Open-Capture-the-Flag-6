Dear Princess Toadstool,
	I'm a pretty neat guy for a fella made of snow. My shoes are always shined, my shirt is always tucked in. Even my hair is perfect. But, I can't walk down the street without some clown yelling, "Hey Frosty! Nice dandruff!" or "Can I buy you 'Head and Shoulders,' sno-cone?"
	Don't they understand? I'm a snowman! Those speckles on my shoulders aren't dandruff flakes--they're snowflakes!
	How can I clean up this mess?
Sincerely,
Flurry

Dear Flurry:
	I really had to scratch my head on this one, but here's what I think. Your real friends will ignore your dandruff...oops, I mean snowflakes. And, if a stranger insults you, just give him the cold shoulder.
