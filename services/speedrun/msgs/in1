Dear Princess Toadstool,
	I'm a successful tyrant, and I'm sure I'd be pretty popular with the ladies if I had a really keen nickname! It may sound crazy, but I've always wanted to be called "Muffin"!
	Here's my question: Where do you steal a nickname?
Tyrantly yours,
Koopa

Dear Koopa:
	You don't steal nicknames... you *earn* them! If you want people to call you "Muffin", you have to give them a reason.
	For a start, I'd suggest eating at least a hundred muffins a day. If that doesn't work, try sending every citizen of Mushroomland a hundred-koopabit bill along with a note signed, "From your friend, *Muffin*."
