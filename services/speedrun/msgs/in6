Dear Princess Toadstool,
	My name is "Phanto" and yes, I wear a mask like the Phantom of the Opera. So here's my beef: Every time I visit someone's house, what kind of music do they play? Opera. And I *hate* opera!
	If I have to listen to one more lady Viking shriek in German, I'm going to go crazy!
Sincerely,
Phanto

Dear Phanto:
	Try taking your own records when you go out. If your friends *still* insist on playing opera, try changing your name to "Elvis." Or "Muffin." And if that doesn't work, you might consider moving to another aria.
