Dear Princess Toadstool,
	We hope you won't think we're hogging all the advice, but we have three questions.
	Number One: We know we're not the handsomest guys in the world. Do you think cosmetic surgery might help?
	Number Two: Although we're not very good-looking now, things may improve... So how about dinner next Thursday?
	Number Three: Last, if we take a princess to dinner and a movie, are we expected to pay for popcorn, too?
Sincerely,
Tryclyde

Dear Tryclyde:
	Let me answer each of your heads--er, questions--seperately.

	Answer number one: Maybe.

	Answer number two: No.

	Answer number three: Yes, but no thanks--times THREE!
