Dear Princess Toadstool,
	I don't have a problem but everyone else does!!!
	If I go to a party, somebody calls the bomb squad!  If I get a flat tire, some jerk always yells, "Hey, why don't you just blow it up?" And then I blow up!
	But, hey, I'm a bomb! It's my nature.  Howe can I get people (and mushrooms) to accept me for what I am?

Sincerely,
Bob-Omb

P.S. If I don't like your answer, I'm going to EXPLODE!

Dear Bob-Omb,
	Sheesh don't blow this out of proportion! Have you considered having a longer fuse installed?  And if you ever feel a real explosion coming on, relaxing in any convenient body of water will work wonders
