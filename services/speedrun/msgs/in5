Dear Princess Toadstool,
	My name is Luigi, and I have a brother named Mario. So far so good, right? The problem is, wherever we go, people say: "Here come the Mario Brothers!"
	It's annoying! I'd rather we were called the *Luigi* Brothers.
	How can I get equal time in the "name game"?
Sincerely,
Luigi

Dear Luigi:
	Ever thought of changing your name to "Muffin"?
